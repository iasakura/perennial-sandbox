# Build pipeline for this perennial-cli sandbox.
#
#   write Go  →  translate to Rocq with goose  →  check proofs with make
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh          # everything (go build -> goose -> make)
#   ./build.sh go       # Go build (type check) only
#   ./build.sh goose    # goose translation (also runs go build)
#   ./build.sh make     # make (proof check) only, assuming translation is done
#
# Why these steps exist (gotchas):
#  - the system go is 1.25 but perennial requires go 1.26
#    → GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.0 is forced
#  - goose/proofgen are not registered as tools in go.mod, so make's automatic
#    goose step does not work; we call the goose bundled with the perennial
#    checkout via --local (same version as the opam pin, so they stay in sync)
#  - .goose-output is touched to tell make the translation is up to date
#    (otherwise make runs the broken goose step and dies)
#  - proofgen sometimes emits a bogus src/generatedproof/_ directory; clean it
set -euo pipefail

# --- configuration (adjust here when the environment changes) ---
